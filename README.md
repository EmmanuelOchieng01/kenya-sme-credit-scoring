# Kenya SME Credit Scoring Model

## Project Overview
This project develops a credit scoring model for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Kenya using machine learning and explainable AI techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build predictive models for SME credit risk assessment
- Implement explainable AI for transparent decision-making
- Create deployable API and dashboard for lenders

## 📊 Dataset
- Simulated Kenyan SME transaction data
- 1,000 SME records across various sectors and locations
- Features include financial metrics, business characteristics, and banking behavior

## 🏆 Best Model
- **Model**: Random Forest
- **AUC Score**: 1.0000
- **Accuracy**: 0.9900

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the model: `python credit_scoring.py`
3. Access the dashboard: `python app.py`
